<h4>Shan Shah's How I Work<h4>

 <h2>About ME</h2>
    <p>My name is Shan Shah. I am a senior in Michigan State University completing studies in Information and Media. After taking diverse courses in multiple colleges within MSU I 
	found my passion working with Web development and IT environment.</p>
	<p>I have taken courses in TISM department that have provided me with basic knowledge of html, css, and JavaScript. I have also worked in IT environment at MSU over the last two years. Currently I am working for 
	Veterinary Teaching Hospital's IT group handling users request and helping them on their day to day job using computers. I plan on using the knowledge gained from my work experence
and the course work involving programming in my future career post graduation in 2014.</p>	
	<p>I have included links at the top of each page that allows user to learn more about my interests, hobbies, background as well as way to reach me by just clicking on 
	the buttons. In this page you will learn about my work environment. </p>
    
	<h2>Work Environment</h2>
   <p>I use mainly windows operating system to do programming for class work. It is easier to navigate on familiar system as I have not worked on mac operating system that much. 
   I do own Ipad air and an I-phone. They are wonderful devices to work with. They do have some limitations when it comes to completing school work. It is easier to browse the internet on the go 
   using these devices rather than having laptop around. Some of the websites don't work perfectly yet on multiple platform which force user to go back to pc environment to get things done. </p>
   
   <p>For completing class work for TC349 I have installed notepad++ as my preferred text editor and Google chrome my testing browser. These two software allow me to work smoothly and make it easier to 
complete given assignments. I see improved version of notepad++ as I used to write html code using notepad before. I do use notepad sometimes when I write css code but that too I have started using
notepad++.</p>

<h2>My goals </h2>
	<ol>
	<li>Get better at html5 and css</li>
	<li>Learn techniques to create better web page</li>
	<li>use the knowledge to apply in future careers</li>
	<li>take the client requirements and furnish website to fit their criteria</li>
	</ol>
